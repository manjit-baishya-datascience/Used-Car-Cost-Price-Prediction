# **Used Car Cost Price Prediction**

This project aims to predict the cost price (CP) of used cars using machine learning techniques. The model uses various features of the car, such as age, mileage, brand, and others, to estimate the initial cost price. The prediction results include a range with minimum and maximum estimates.

## Project Overview
The used car market is vast, and accurately predicting the cost price of a used car can help buyers and sellers make informed decisions. This project utilizes machine learning models to predict the cost price, providing a range within which the price is likely to fall.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features of used cars, such as:
- Age of the car
- Mileage
- Brand and model
- Fuel type
- Transmission type
- Engine size

## Usage
To run the prediction model:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data as required.
3. Train the model using the training data.
4. Use the trained model to predict the cost price of new data.
5. The results will include a range with minimum and maximum estimates of the cost price.

## Model
The machine learning model used in this project is trained on historical data of used car prices. The model uses gradient boosting techniques to achieve high accuracy in predictions. The output provides an estimated range of the cost price.

## Results
The prediction results include two columns:
- `CP(min)`: The minimum estimated cost price.
- `CP(max)`: The maximum estimated cost price.

These estimates are calculated with a margin of error to account for possible variations in the market conditions.
